# Catsignment

Thanks for giving me the opportunity to do this assignment. When I started two weeks ago I had zero experience with Angular. Now, two weeks later, I think Iâ€™m starting to get a good view on the framework and I managed to complete quite some topics from the assignment. I really enjoyed learning Angular.

Learning the framework obviously took quite some time. I have tried to set up the project as broad as possible to highlight the topics from the assignment. I could not go all the way in depth everywhere, but tried to show some logic as well.

In the files I wrote code comments, and sometimes a little story. These are usually in the component file, and sometimes at the bottom when it is a longer piece where I have written down some thoughts. I think it would be nice to be able to explain some things in person.

I did start writing tests, but I haven't been able to finish much. I found out that when it comes to testing in Angular, there are quite a few differences compared to React when it comes to the configuration. I would like to scope the assignment a bit due to some obligations next week. Also I think the time invested should be enough to show how I manage to learn a new framework and build a project in that. I leave this topic for now, but it will be the first topic I will pick up when I continue learning Angular.
